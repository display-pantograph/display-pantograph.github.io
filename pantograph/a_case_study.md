title: For example R., a case study
info: "With the increasing digitization of private and public archives in the last ten years, an incredible source of materials has become accessible. How do we deal with this abundance of sources? How do we approach the past? How can a classroom serve as a space for critical historical inquiries and discussions, particularly for graphic and type design students new to historical research and the discourse around the construction of historical narratives?"
info-long: "From mid-October to mid-December, we collectively examined surviving posters of R, one of numerous poster printers active between c.1845 to1867 in Paris, a period often excluded in today’s design curriculum.
In contrast to his contemporaries, R’s approach was distinctive. Not only were the dimensions of his posters, often exceeding two meters, uncommon, but also the amalgamation of various techniques and the extensive use of multiple colors stand out from today’s perspective. This was possible as R drew upon knowledge derived from printing techniques previously reserved for the manual production of luxurious multicolored wall papers around the turn of the 18th-century. These techniques involved the manual application of color through brushes, stencils or printing forms (clichés) and the reproduction of colored illustrations in various sizes facilitated by the capabilities of the pantograph, a tool to proportionally enlarge or reduce templates."
