title: Octagon Variable
info: "Optical illusions were a very present theme within the typographical landscape of the nineteenth century."
info-long: "The three-dimensional letter becomes omnipresent in print but also in public signage. There, three-dimensional letterforms were made from materials like metal, bricks or clay. Octagon, a contrasted sans serif from 1838, has possibly its source in the replication of such dimensional store fronts. It is an early skeuomorph. Unremittingly, three-dimensional letters explored multiple forms and started to cast shadows in all imaginable directions and move within the third dimension. Rob Roy Kelly believed this design to have originated in France. Maybe, as such geometric letterforms survived on some lithographic posters from the 1840s to the 1860s in France. But don’t underestimate the role of manufacturing methods. Straight lines can be easier to manufacture. Just think of the the Hollywood signage! Today, the original Octagon wood blocks of a full uppercase set (no figures or lowercase seem to have existed) in 8-line are part of the RRK collection in Austin, Texas. In class, we re-imagined the design and pushed the already present spatial illusions further collaboratively: Octacon Variable."
