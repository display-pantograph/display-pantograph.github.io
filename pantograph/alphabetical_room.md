title: Alphabetical Room
info: "Drawing inspiration from Josef-Müller Brockmann’s 1961 grid concept for interior design, the publication “The Alphabetical Room” presents Liad Shadmi’s  typographic exploration into the boundaries and limits of writing within a strictly calculated mathematical three-dimensional grid."
info-long: "Throughout the publication, Liad Shadmi systematically investigates these grids, examining the viewer’s changing perspective along with the changing resolution of these hypothetical letterforms. Accompanying the publication is a brief introductory essay by Liad, shedding light on the enduring fascination of graphic designers, programmers, creative coders, and visual artists with this subject. The work was created within the type design course “Letter shapes are entirely described by numbers” in 2022 and was awarded as a “Prize nominee work” at the TDC Tokyo and at the TDC New York."
