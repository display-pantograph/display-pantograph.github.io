title: Alphabetical Room
info: "Drawing inspiration from Josef-Müller Brockmann’s 1961 grid concept for architectural spaces, the publication “The Alphabetical Room” presents Liad Shadmi’s  typographic exploration into the boundaries and limits of writing within a strictly calculated mathematical three-dimensional grid."
info-long: "Throughout the publication, Liad Shadmi systematically investigates these grids, examining the viewer’s changing perspective along with the changing resolution of these hypothetical letterforms. Accompanying the publication is a brief introductory essay by Liad, shedding light on the enduring fascination of graphic designers, programmers, creative coders, and visual artists with this subject. The work was created within the type design course “Letter shapes are entirely described by numbers” in 2022 and was awarded as <a href=https://tokyotypedirectorsclub.org/en/news/tdc2023-results/ target=_blank>TDC Tokyo Prize Nominee</a> in Japan, received a <a href=https://www.oneclub.org/awards/tdcawards/-award/46404/the-alphabetical-room target=_blank>Certificate of Typographic Excellence</a> at the New York Type Directors Club 69 and was featured on <a href=https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/liad-shadmi-the-alphabetical-room-project-graphic-design-270323 target=_blank>It’s Nice That.</a>"
