title: Alphabetical Room
info: "A systematic exploration into the boundaries and limits of writing within a strictly calculated mathematical three dimensional grid within the flat digital space."
info-long: "Treating the three dimensional grid in the second dimensional digital space was always an intriguing matter for graphic designers, programmers, creative coders and visual artists. Starting from Josef-Müller Brockmann’s grid proposal for the design of interior spaces in 1961, the perspective of the viewer changes throughout the pages of the leaflet as does the resolution of the three dimensional grids in which the hypothetical letterforms are displayed. In addition I wrote a short introductory essay on the historical and on-going fascination of graphic designers, programmers, creative coders and visual artists on that topic."
