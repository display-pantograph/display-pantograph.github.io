title: Octagon Variable, Type Specimen
info: "Printed on 45gsm salmon-colored newsprint, this specimen celebrates the open-source launch of “Octagon Variable”, an educational type design project."
info-long: "Based on Octagon – a wood type first shown in George Nesbitt’s First Premium Wood Types Cut by Machinery in 1838 – “Octagon Variable” is a reimagination of the original design by Edwin Allen. Today, the original Octagon wood blocks of a full uppercase set in 8-line (no figures or lowercase seem to have existed) are part of the <a href=https://rrk.finearts.utexas.edu/?dt_portfolio=octagon? target=_blank>Rob Roy Kelly collection</a> in Austin, Texas. As part of a first year type design introduction class, we re-drew and re-imagined the design and pushed the already present spatial illusions further collaboratively. The specimen is completed by a short text that traces the origin of the typeface.
<br>
“Octagon Variable” was designed by Alexander Royter, Emma Schmalisch, Felix Willnauer, Friederike Temme, Greta Wachholz, Jason Tsiakas, Julia Baskal, Julia Schmidt, Kaja Wetzel, Kateryna Shelevytska, Lara Tamminga, Nina Vierke Liyani, Sania Salem, Sarah-Ann Roehlen, Sofiya Slyusarenko, Stina Scholz, Vanessa Schneider, Zoe Rygus with contributions by Pierre Pane-Farre and Simon Thiefes. “Octagon Variable” is made available under the Open Font License and can be downloaded as static as well as variable font file <a href=https://github.com/haw-type-design/octagon-variable/releases target=_blank>over here.</a> More information can be found on the <a href=https://github.com/haw-type-design/octagon-variable target=_blank>git hub repository.</a> "
